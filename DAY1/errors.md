Summary of Bugs Found
File: lib/reviver.js
Bug: Fails to handle missing message, name, or stack properties, leading to incorrect Error object revival.
Fix: Added default values and conditional checks for these properties.
File: lib/stack.js
Bug: Returns undefined if err.stack is not available, instead of a string, which can cause issues in environments where stack is not supported.
Fix: Added a fallback string to ensure the function always returns a string.
